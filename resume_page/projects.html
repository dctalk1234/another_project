            <h3>Blackjack</h3>
            <p>
                Last spring I created a fully functional automated blackjack game.
                My game could account for any number of players. Each player had a hand and through the game logic would be 
                prompted with decisions allowing them to hit, double down, split, stay at the oppropriate time.
                The dealer was completing automated and following the conclusion of a hand would calculate the needed payments to each player.

            <h3>RPG</h3>
            <p>
                At the start of the summer as apart of a school final project I completed my own text based rpg.
                The story mode had 10 levels each with two waves of enemies and a boss. There was also a boss rush (where you played faught each boss in order) and 
                a endless mode that randomly generated basic enemies in waves to fight infinitely. In between levels the user could purchase upgrades to things like hp, attack, and armor.
